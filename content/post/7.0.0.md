## Changes
**Plugin Refactoring:**
- Conducted a comprehensive overhaul of the entire plugin, implementing full refactoring for improved code quality and maintainability. Even though we maintained the number of lines of code and increased the number of classes, we reduced the total cyclomatic complexity from 2044 to 1310. Our code has fewer branches, which increases maintainability. This refactoring is designed to improve the quality of feature releases and provide developer users with a greater understanding of the code.

**Additional Information Node Improvement:**
  - Elevated the functionality and user experience of the additional information node within the plugin by enriching the payment metadata with additional details, strategically aimed at boosting the payment approval rate.

## Fixes
**Conditional Logging in STEP 2:**
  - Consolidated logging behavior in STEP 2 by ensuring that logs are recorded only when the corresponding toggle in the admin (STEP 2) is activated. Previously, the plugin recorded logs irrespective of the toggle's status, but with this fix, the toggle now functions correctly.

## Additions
**Payment Implementation with 3DS Security Flow:**
  - Integrating 3DS 2.0 (3-D Secure Authentication 2.0) technology. This advancement enables the authentication of transactions involving credit and debit cards in e-commerce scenarios, ensuring that the person making the purchase is genuinely the cardholder or has authorized access to the cardholder's accounts for completing the payment. An authenticated transaction offers several advantages, including a higher likelihood of approval, mitigating chargeback losses for the seller, and reducing the risk of fraud for the buyer, among other benefits.

  - In practical terms, enhancing the approval process for potentially questionable payments involves triggering a modal at the checkout stage. This modal presents a security challenge that the buyer must address for validation. The following illustrates an example of what the buyer can expect to encounter:
